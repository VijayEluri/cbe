# Cayenne by Example

Welcome to the Cayenne by Example project.

Cayenne by Example illustrates some of the major features of the [Apache Cayenne](http://cayenne.apache.org/) ORM framework through standalone examples (runnable by [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), each a standalone [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) project).

The project consists of two parts:

1. The [source code](https://github.com/mrg/cbe) for the project, which you have already found here at GitHub.
2. The [book](http://mrg.github.com/cbe/index.html) for the project, hosted by GitHub Pages.

**NOTE: This project is under development and the source code and book may not always agree.**

The source code is inside the folders of this project, organized by chapter/feature.  Each standalone project tries to include enough JavaDoc to help you understand what the code is doing, but you are also encouraged to reference the book when needed.

Feedback is appreciated.  Open an issue for any problems.

Thanks!
