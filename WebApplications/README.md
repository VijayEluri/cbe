Web Applications
================

Not much here yet.  Mainly a stub/skeleton, but the `pom.xml`, `web.xml`, and `jetty-env.xml` are relatively functional.

This example will ultimately have a simple Tapestry 5 + Cayenne application running inside Jetty and can do CRUD operations.

To run:

    mvn jetty:run

Then point your browser to http://localhost:7890/cbe.
