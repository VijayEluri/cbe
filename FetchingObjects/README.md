Fetching Objects
================

These examples focus on using Cayenne to fetch objects from a database.  Each example will build a small database to fetch from, but the main examples will focus on fetching (the inserting is handled outside of the main example, but is easy to follow and step into).

* Aggregates: Shows how to use database aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM) using Cayenne expressions.
* Counting:: Shows how to do a database COUNT function using Cayenne expressions.  This precedes the Aggregates example and is probably easier to understand as Aggregates does COUNT and more.
* Single Table Inheritance: Shows how to map inheritance.
